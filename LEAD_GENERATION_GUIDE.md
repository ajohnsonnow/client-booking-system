## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Lead Magnet Creation
- **Focus on ONE specific problem**: "Balance your chakras in 7 days" > "General healing guide"
- **Promise quick wins**: "7-Day" feels achievable
- **Use AI but personalize**: Edit AI content to match your voice
- **Test multiple magnets**: See which converts best

### 2. Drip Campaign Strategy
- **Day 0**: Deliver the promise (send the lead magnet)
- **Day 2**: Provide value (free tip/practice)
- **Day 5**: Build trust (story/testimonial)
- **Day 8**: Make the ask (book a session)
- **Day 14**: Follow up (check in)

### 3. Follow-Up Timing
- **New leads**: Contact within 24 hours
- **Prospects**: Follow up every 3-5 days
- **Qualified**: Weekly check-ins until booking
- **Clients**: Monthly newsletters

### 4. Conversion Optimization
- A/B test lead magnet titles
- Simplify forms (email only = higher conversion)
- Use urgency: "Limited spots available"
- Add social proof: "Join 500+ healing seekers"

- Test the form yourself to create a test lead

### "Drip campaigns not sending"
- Ensure campaign status is "Active"
- Check trigger matches lead source
- Verify emails were generated (not empty)

### "Low conversion rates"
- Simplify lead magnet title (be specific)
- Reduce form fields (email only)
- Add urgency/scarcity to CTA
- Test different headlines

### "Leads not progressing through funnel"
- Review follow-up cadence (too slow?)
- Improve email content (more value?)
- Add personal touch (manual outreach?)
- Create urgency (limited time offer?)
