              <p class="lead-text">Do you feel a deep, sensual desire to express your sacred sexuality?</p>
          <p>You long to feel unconditional love and to be seen in all your vulnerability, but a quiet disconnect has settled between your spirit and your body. Maybe you've felt it for a long time—a whisper of something more, a yearning to be touched in ways that heal and nurture not just your body but your spirit too.</p>
              <p><strong>This is an invitation to reclaim that connection.</strong> To move beyond cultural conditioning, shedding what no longer brings you joy.</p>
              <p>In our time together, we'll attune our energy fields to co-create a compassionate, grounded space. I exude a very maternal divine feminine presence, and I hope to help you feel worthy of unconditional nurturing, and especially of your own self love.</p>
              <p>I want you to feel like the hero of your own story, reclaiming your sacred sexual sovereignty and joyful self expression. I am simply a guide here to help you relearn how to receive and share sensual touch.</p>
              <div class="lotus-divider">🪷</div>
              <p>We'll work together to unravel the threads of sexual shame and cultural conditioning, and to rebalance the flow of masculine and feminine energies within you. This is your journey toward a new kind of freedom—one where your body is a sacred temple and your spirit is free to soar.</p>

            <h2 id="about-title">About Me</h2>
            <p>The first profession I ever wanted was to be a masseuse. My parents, who nicknamed me "magic fingers," gently steered me away from bodywork. Forty years later, I've rediscovered my true calling to bring healing and joy through sensual touch.</p>
            <p>My journey here began in the long process of ending my 18-year marriage. For years, like so many others, after birthing three babies I felt disconnected from my own sexual energy. Then, a heart chakra opening and a kundalini reawakening supercharged my spirit.</p>
            <p>I found myself drawn to tantric bodywork, not just as a practitioner, but as a student of my own healing. In my first pelvic ritual, I experienced a heart chakra opening so massive it was followed by a third eye opening and a hand chakra activation. It felt like hummingbirds buzzing at the molecular level, filling my hands with energy.</p>
            <div class="about-highlight">
              <p>I believe this energy is a sacred gift that I am meant to share with others.</p>
            </div>
            <p>With both Venus and Mars in Taurus in the eighth house of sexuality, my energy is a mix of fierce masculine and flowy feminine, all rooted in an earthy nurturing groundedness. My astrological readings have always told me I have intuitive gifts and that I would one day heal with my hands. <em>I believe that time is now.</em></p>
            <p>I am attuned to second degree reiki from the Usui/Tibetan Reiki Ryoho lineage. I feel honored and grateful to feel and share such healing energy.</p>
            <p class="credit-note">I want to give credit to Amara Karuna, who I apprenticed with for over two years and who teaches the unique Sacred Pelvic Healing Rituals and BlissFlow modalities that inspire and guide my sessions.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-1" hidden>
              <p>I enjoy beginning sessions with warm hugs and a brief guided meditation to help ground and begin to attune our energy. I also want to know your desires and boundaries, and to voice an intention for the session. 🙌🙏💗</p>
              <p>Sessions will begin with a sensual touch of your back and buttocks, before rolling over to sensually touch your sexual organs. Throughout the session I will do my best to be responsive to your sensitivity level, going as slow/gentle as you need (please speak up or give hand gestures).</p>
              <p>Even with gentle touch, sessions can trigger deep emotional release. I expect that you may cry or have an emotional release, and I will do my best to hold space and pause in place, unless there is a voiced desire to stop.</p>
              <p>You may become aroused to the point of orgasm. Please note that orgasm doesn't need to be a goal of sessions. From my perspective, it can be very powerful to use your breath and intention to move your erotic energy into the rest of your body, especially when you start at the heart chakra.</p>
              <p>Honestly, I love being a witness to your deep and expansive pleasure, and yet seeing your heart open and spirit lift is my greatest hope and gift. 💝</p>

              <p>My firm boundaries are that I keep on my bottom underwear, and there's no kissing on the mouth or touching of my yoni. 🙏</p>
              <p>I also want to feel that I'm respected and I find consent both essential and sexy. So, I expect and appreciate when you ask before touching me. Aside from me feeling good, my hope is that this will help you be more mindful. 💕</p>

              <p>Please be patient with booking sessions. I currently have more inquiries than I can fill in a week. Priority is given to people who want biweekly or monthly sessions. 🙏</p>

              <p>Even though I cannot guarantee chakra clearing or any specific healing, I offer a unique presence of humility and humor. With both Venus and Mars in Taurus in the eighth house of sexuality, my energy is a mix of flowy feminine and fierce masculine that's rooted in earthy groundedness.</p>
              <p>In a Soul Plan reading, I was told that I have a strong drive to bring spirituality into the physical realm, and that I am meant to serve as a bridge. In every astrology reading, I've been told that I have intuitive gifts and that at some point I would heal with my hands.</p>
              <p>I believe that time is now, and if you're still reading this, then we're meant to explore working together. 🙏💖🙌</p>

              <p>I was first called to sexual healing in the long process of ending my 18-year marriage. Like many married couples, our sex was routine and primarily focused on pleasing him. And like many women, after years of feeling sexually unsatisfied, birthing three children, plus more years of never having my yoni savored, I became disconnected with my sexual energy.</p>
              <p>Then I experienced a heart chakra opening, followed by a kundalini reawakening, which supercharged my sexual energy. I already enjoyed a daily meditation practice, so I decided to search up "orgasmic meditation" and found OMing.</p>
              <p>When I was invited to join a Sacred Pelvic Healing Massage retreat with neo-tantric leaders, Amara Karuna and Ray Cohen, I was excited to learn the modality. With my first pelvic massage, I experienced a massive heart chakra opening…then a third eye opening…then more heart opening, followed by hand chakra activation.</p>
              <p>As an apprentice, I've been humbled to learn how to serve as a channel of divine love and energy healing. I also recently received Level I and Level II reiki attunements.</p>

            <p>I have worked with Ravi over the past two years and have found her to be enthusiastic, talented, intuitive and a committed practitioner. Her passion for this work is obvious and helps to create a nurturing and safe container to open and explore what will bring healing and a fuller expression of yourself as a sexual being. I highly recommend working with Ravi to anyone who seeks to be held in a loving and nurturing embrace to open, heal and experience deeper pleasure and joy through sacred touch.</p>

            <p>I was experiencing debilitating pain, and I went to see my physician, began pelvic floor physical therapy, and saw Ravi to help resolve my pain. The trifecta of approaches worked. I appreciate Ravi's willingness to work with me. I highly recommend her respectful, caring, healing touch. 💖</p>

            <p>The experience was pivotal for me as my first introduction to a pelvic massage. I'd never experienced anything like it. Now I will always remember how Ravi made the experience feel. It could not have been more comfortable, relaxing, and enjoyable.</p>
            <p>Ravi's co-creating presence helped bring in a nurturing aura of connection, through breath work, touch, eye contact, expressions and movements. Her practice in co-creating a bond resulted in deep connection, a pleasurable healing container that allowed the movement of energy and emotional release.</p>
            <p>As a result I now know what I truly yearn for when engaged in intimate sensual and sexual moments… a deep sacred connection that is abundant with a wholesomeness of energetic awareness, flow and syncretism. I now have a framework practice of how to co-create a bond with future partners, thanks to Ravi.</p>
            <p><strong>Plainly speaking I loved it, it was beautiful and breathtaking and giving. Thank you Ravi.</strong></p>
